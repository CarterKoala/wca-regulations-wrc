# WCA Regulations

This repository contains the the WCA Regulations and Guidelines, which apply to all official competitions sanctioned by the [World Cube Association](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/).

Official competitions must always use the current version of the Regulations at <https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/>, which matches the branch named [`official`](https://github.com/thewca/wca-regulations/tree/official) on GitHub.

The current draft for upcoming Regulations is maintained on the branch named [`draft`](https://github.com/thewca/wca-regulations/tree/draft).
